For all designs I ask you to make them beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages and apps that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the react bits library, 21st Dev library, Radix UI, Three.js libraries, Park UI, Aceternity UI, React hooks, Lucide React, Lottie Files, and W3 Schools library. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use 3D icons for logos.
